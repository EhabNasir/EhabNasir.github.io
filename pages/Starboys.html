        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Low Fantasia is a 2D metroidvania where players explore interconnected levels, unlock new spells, and take on challenging enemies and bosses.. 
            I worked on this during my first year of university, and it was made in the Unity game engine using c#.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>My goal with Low Fantasia was to improve my game architecture and optimisation skills. I thought a metroidvania would be a great way to practise this. 
            I spent a lot of time focusing on persistent data that carries over to new scenes, as well as Optimisation. 
            I also wanted to get a better understanding on enemy AI by working on some enemies and a boss.

        <h2>Player Movement System</h2>
        <p>Overview: Developed a versitile 2D player controller supporting platforming, exploration and combat</p>
        <p>Key Features

            Core Movement: Smooth horizontal movement with direction flipping, tuned acceleration, and handling for both grounded and airborne states.

Advanced Jumping: Variable jump heights, multiple jumps, and double jump tracking via a jump counter system.

Environmental Interactions: Climbing (walls), hanging (ceilings/ledges), and gravity adjustments depending on state.

Ability Integration: Centralized booleans and event system to toggle movement abilities (jump, double jump, climb, hang, dash, freeze, slam) as they are unlocked.

Animation Handling: Direct integration with an animation state machine for responsive transitions (idle, run, jump, climb, hang).
        </p>
        <p>
            Technical Design Choices

Used Unity’s physics system (Rigidbody2D, OverlapBox, OverlapCircle) for ground/wall/ceiling detection to keep movement grounded in physics.

Normalized input through a dedicated handler (GetHorizontalInput) to ensure consistent control across different states.

Implemented state checks (isGrounded, isClimbing, isHanging) to avoid conflicting abilities and guarantee predictable behavior.

Applied modular ability management (AddMovementAbility, SetAbilitiesStatus) to allow seamless progression when new abilities unlock.
        </p>
        <p>
            Challenges & Solutions

Challenge: Jump consistency varied at different framerates.
Solution: Used FixedUpdate for physics calculations and adjusted force application with deltaTime to keep jump height consistent.

Challenge: Preventing combat inputs from interfering with climbing/hanging states.
Solution: Disabled attack functionality (PlayerCombat.Instance.canAttack) during climb/hang states, restoring it when grounded or released.

Challenge: Handling “drop from hang” mechanics without breaking gravity.
Solution: Wrote a coroutine (Drop()) that temporarily disables hanging, restores gravity, and re-enables abilities after a cooldown.
